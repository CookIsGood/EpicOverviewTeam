## [](https://github.com/CookIsGood/epicoveviewteam#theprojectstatus)The project status
At the moment, the project is under development, but the main functions have already been added!

## [](https://github.com/CookIsGood/epicoveviewteam#source)Source
The idea to write this site appeared after I saw a [service for choosing characters](http://npc233.com/play/index.php/Home/Game/ep_ss). It was with minimal functionality, and therefore I wanted to write a similar project, but with more advanced functionality, and most importantly, make this service available to ordinary users.
